# ngtodo-nodejs-source
Server Source of my Todo application [NGTODO](https://github.com/ar124official2019/ngtodo-angular-source/ "Frontend")

This app is part of my learning Journy! I created this app for challanging my NodeJS and Angular skills.

# About App
This is a simple todo application for creating Todos! This would run on local server to be in action. This is not to be deployed, but if you find it useful, you may clone and tweak it to be deployed!

INFACT THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS APP, LAUNCHING SERVER AND USING `FRONTEND` BUILD OF [NGTODO](https://github.com/ar124official2019/ngtodo-angular-source/ "Frontend") TO SHOW THAT IN ACTION.

WARNING!!! THIS IS AN INSECURE SERVER SOURCE. DEPLOYING THIS IN PRACTISE WOULD NOT BE FINE!
MAY BE LATER I WOULD TRY TO MAKE IT SECURE USING HTTPS AND ENCODING/DECODING WHILE DATA TRANSFER, BUT EVEN THAT WOULD NOT MAKE IT READY TO BE DEPLOYED!

If you want to improve its security layer, I would feel encouraged at that. Improve and make
a pull request.

# TESTING AND TASTING
Sure, I don't need to guide experts but here is guide to taste this app on Linux/Unix for beginners
  1. clone repository

    git clone https://github.com/ar124official2019/ngtodo-nodejs-source

  2. change directory to newly created repo directory

    cd ngtodo-nodejs-source

  3. install dependencies, npm need to be installed on your machine

    npm install

  4. start server, Please note down the port number logged on startup

    npm start

  5. now open your favorite browser and navigte to url 
    http://127.0.0.1:PORT to see it running where PORT is port displayed on `npm start`
    Usually it would be 3000 so url would be http://127.0.0.1:3000
